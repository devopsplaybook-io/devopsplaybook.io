## Principles

GitOps is a software development and operations approach that leverages the version control system Git as the single source of truth for managing infrastructure, applications, and their configurations. It emphasizes using Git's capabilities for declarative infrastructure and application management, automation, and collaboration.

In GitOps, the desired state of the infrastructure and applications is defined in Git repositories, typically in the form of declarative configuration files. The Git repository serves as the central source for all configuration changes, which are versioned, reviewed, and audited. The GitOps workflow involves a continuous reconciliation process where the desired state stored in Git is automatically applied to the target environment by a GitOps operator or controller.

```

Key principles and components of GitOps include:

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): The infrastructure is defined and managed using code, allowing for versioning, review, and reproducibility. Tools like Terraform or Kubernetes manifests are often used to define infrastructure resources.
- Git as the Single Source of Truth: Git repositories serve as the source of truth for both application code and infrastructure configurations. Any changes made to the system are made through Git commits, making them auditable and allowing for collaboration.
- Continuous Deployment and Automation: GitOps encourages continuous deployment practices by automatically applying changes stored in Git to the target environment. Automation tools, such as GitOps controllers or operators, monitor the Git repository and ensure that the desired state is applied consistently.
- Declarative Configurations: Infrastructure and application configurations are defined declaratively in Git repositories, describing the desired state rather than prescribing explicit steps for deployment or provisioning. This allows for easier review, change tracking, and convergence towards the desired state.
- Observability and Monitoring: GitOps emphasizes observability by continuously monitoring the deployed system and comparing it with the desired state stored in Git. Any deviations or discrepancies trigger alerts, enabling teams to quickly identify and address issues.

## Relationship with DevOps

### Advantages

- Simplified Operations: GitOps centralizes configuration management and deployment pipelines, making it easier to manage and automate infrastructure and application deployments.
- Version Control: GitOps leverages Git's version control capabilities, enabling teams to track changes, roll back to previous versions, and review and collaborate on configuration changes effectively.
- Consistency and Reproducibility: By defining infrastructure and application configurations as code stored in Git repositories, GitOps ensures consistent and reproducible deployments across environments.
- Traceability and Auditing: GitOps provides a clear audit trail of all changes made to the infrastructure and application configurations, making it easier to track who made changes and when.
- Immutable Infrastructure: GitOps promotes the use of immutable infrastructure, where infrastructure and application changes are made by deploying new versions instead of modifying existing resources. This approach improves reliability and simplifies rollbacks.
- Continuous Delivery: GitOps enables continuous delivery practices by automatically applying changes to the infrastructure and applications whenever there are updates pushed to the Git repository, reducing manual intervention and enabling faster delivery cycles.
- Collaboration and Visibility: GitOps allows multiple team members to collaborate on configuration changes using familiar Git workflows, facilitating better communication and visibility into the deployment process.

### Disadvantages

- Learning Curve: Adopting GitOps requires a learning curve, particularly for teams not familiar with Git or version control systems. Training and onboarding may be necessary to ensure all team members understand and use GitOps effectively.
- Dependency on Git: GitOps heavily relies on Git as the central source of truth for configuration management. If there are issues with the Git repository or its availability, it can impact the deployment process.
- Complex Configurations: For complex infrastructure or application configurations, managing everything through Git repositories may become challenging. Careful design and organization of repositories and configurations are necessary to maintain manageability.
- Potential Security Risks: Storing infrastructure and application configurations in Git repositories poses security risks if proper access controls and security measures are not implemented. Safeguarding the repositories and managing secrets is crucial to prevent unauthorized access.
- Limited Offline Capabilities: GitOps assumes continuous connectivity to the Git repository to fetch and apply changes. In scenarios where network connectivity is limited or intermittent, it may hinder the deployment process.
- Potential Overhead: While GitOps streamlines operations, it may introduce additional overhead in terms of managing and maintaining the GitOps pipeline, ensuring proper synchronization between Git and the infrastructure, and monitoring deployments.
