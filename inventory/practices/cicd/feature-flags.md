## Principles

Feature flags, also known as feature toggles or feature switches, are a software development technique that allows developers to enable or disable specific features or functionality in an application without modifying or redeploying the code. By using feature flags, developers can control the visibility and behavior of features in runtime, providing flexibility and enabling gradual rollouts and experimentation.

## Relationship with DevOps

### Advantages

- Controlled feature rollout: Feature flags allow gradual rollouts of new features, enabling developers to release functionality to a subset of users or specific environments to gather feedback and test the feature's performance before a full release.
- Continuous deployment: With feature flags, new features can be merged into the main codebase but hidden behind a flag until they are ready for release. This enables continuous deployment practices by decoupling deployment from feature release.
- A/B testing and experimentation: Feature flags enable A/B testing by enabling different variations of a feature for different user groups, allowing developers to collect data and make data-driven decisions. It also allows for experimentation and rapid iteration based on user feedback.
- Hotfixes and rollbacks: In case of issues or bugs, feature flags can be used to quickly disable problematic features or roll back to a previous version without deploying new code, reducing downtime and mitigating risks.

### Disadvantages

- Increased complexity: Implementing and managing feature flags introduces additional complexity to the codebase, especially when dealing with numerous flags or complex feature combinations. This complexity can lead to technical debt if not managed properly.
- Flag proliferation: Over time, as the number of features and flags increases, it can become challenging to maintain and track the different flags, leading to confusion and potential performance overhead.
- Testing and maintenance: Feature flags require thorough testing to ensure that the application behaves as expected with different combinations of enabled and disabled features. Additionally, ongoing maintenance is required to clean up obsolete flags and prevent flag-related bugs.
- Codebase clutter: Depending on the implementation approach, feature flags can result in codebase clutter with conditional statements and additional branches, potentially affecting code readability and maintainability.
