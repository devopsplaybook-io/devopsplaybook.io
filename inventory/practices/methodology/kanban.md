## Principles

Kanban is a project management methodology that originated from the manufacturing industry and has been widely adopted in software development and various other domains. It is a visual system for managing work, focusing on optimizing workflow, reducing bottlenecks, and enhancing overall productivity.

In Kanban, work items are represented as cards or sticky notes on a Kanban board, which consists of columns representing different stages of the workflow. The board provides a visual representation of the work in progress, allowing teams to monitor the status of tasks and identify areas that require attention.

The principles of Kanban are based on its core philosophy of visualizing work, limiting work in progress, and enhancing flow. These principles guide the implementation and effective use of Kanban in various domains. Here are the foundational principles of Kanban:

- Visualize the Workflow: The first principle of Kanban is to visualize the workflow. This involves creating a visual representation of work items and their progression through different stages of the workflow. Kanban boards are commonly used to represent this visually, with columns representing each stage and cards representing individual work items. Visualizing the workflow helps teams understand the current status of work, identify bottlenecks, and improve overall visibility and transparency.
- Limit Work in Progress (WIP): Kanban emphasizes limiting the number of work items in progress at any given time. By setting explicit WIP limits for each stage of the workflow, teams can avoid overloading team members and maintain a balanced workflow. Limiting WIP helps reduce context switching, improves focus, and enables faster completion of work items. It also highlights bottlenecks and encourages collaboration to resolve them.
- Manage Flow: The flow of work is a critical aspect of Kanban. The focus is on ensuring a smooth and continuous flow of work through the entire workflow. Kanban promotes optimizing the flow by identifying and addressing constraints, removing obstacles, and streamlining the process. Teams analyze the flow metrics, such as cycle time and lead time, to measure and improve the efficiency and predictability of work delivery.
- Make Process Policies Explicit: Kanban emphasizes making process policies explicit. This involves clearly defining and documenting the rules, policies, and guidelines that govern the workflow. Explicit process policies help create a shared understanding among team members, improve consistency, and enable effective decision-making. These policies may include criteria for moving work items between stages, priority rules, quality standards, or any other guidelines specific to the workflow.
- Improve Collaboratively, Evolve Experimentally: Kanban promotes a culture of continuous improvement and evolutionary change. Team members are encouraged to collaborate, share feedback, and seek opportunities for improvement. Kanban encourages small, incremental changes to the workflow based on experimentation and feedback. This iterative approach fosters a culture of learning, adaptation, and ongoing optimization.
- Respect Current Roles, Responsibilities, and Titles: Kanban recognizes and respects the existing roles, responsibilities, and titles within the organization. It encourages teams to work with the existing structure and adapt Kanban practices within the context of their roles. Kanban does not prescribe specific roles or require a drastic reorganization, allowing teams to leverage their existing expertise and responsibilities.

## Relationship with DevOps

### Advantages

- Visualization of work: Kanban boards provide a clear visual representation of the work items and their progress through the workflow. This promotes transparency, helps teams understand the current state of work, and facilitates effective communication and collaboration.
- Flexibility and adaptability: Kanban is a highly flexible methodology that allows teams to adapt to changing requirements and priorities. It enables the team to reprioritize tasks and adjust the workflow dynamically based on the current needs, promoting agility and responsiveness.
- WIP (Work in Progress) limits: Kanban emphasizes limiting the number of work items in progress at any given time. This helps prevent overloading team members, reduces multitasking, and improves focus on completing tasks before taking up new ones. WIP limits also expose bottlenecks in the workflow, enabling teams to identify and address efficiency issues.
- Continuous flow and faster delivery: Kanban promotes a continuous flow of work, aiming to minimize wait times and maximize the throughput of completed tasks. By focusing on completing work items rather than starting new ones, teams can achieve faster delivery and shorter lead times.
- Continuous improvement: Kanban encourages continuous improvement through regular team retrospectives and data-driven analysis of the workflow. Teams can identify areas for improvement, implement changes, and measure the impact of those changes, fostering a culture of ongoing learning and optimization.

### Disadvantages

- Lack of structured planning: Kanban is less prescriptive compared to methodologies like Scrum, which can lead to a lack of structured planning and estimation. This may make it challenging to predict delivery dates or plan long-term roadmaps, especially for complex projects with many dependencies.
- Dependency management: Kanban boards typically focus on individual work items and may not provide a holistic view of dependencies between tasks. This can make it difficult to manage dependencies and coordinate work across teams or projects.
- Limited focus on team roles: Kanban does not explicitly define specific roles or responsibilities, which may result in ambiguity or a lack of clarity regarding team members' roles and expectations. This can be mitigated through clear communication and establishing shared understanding within the team.
- Risk of excessive work in progress: While WIP limits are beneficial, there is a risk that teams may set overly aggressive limits or fail to enforce them consistently. This can lead to excessive work in progress, reduced focus, and decreased productivity.
- Less emphasis on timeboxing and iteration: Unlike methodologies such as Scrum, Kanban does not prescribe fixed timeboxes or iterations for work. This can make it challenging to establish a regular cadence and may require additional discipline to ensure timely delivery and stakeholder engagement.
