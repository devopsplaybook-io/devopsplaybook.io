## Principles

Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is a security testing technique that analyzes the source code, byte code, or binary code of an application to identify potential security vulnerabilities and weaknesses. SAST tools perform a static analysis of the application's codebase without executing the application itself, focusing on code structure, logic, and potential security flaws.

## Relationship with DevOps

### Advantages

- Early detection of vulnerabilities: SAST can identify security vulnerabilities early in the software development life cycle, even before the application is deployed. This enables developers to address the issues during the development phase, reducing the cost and effort required for later-stage vulnerability remediation.
- Comprehensive analysis: SAST tools perform a thorough and in-depth analysis of the application's source code, providing a comprehensive assessment of potential security flaws. They can identify a wide range of vulnerabilities, including common coding mistakes, insecure coding practices, and known software weaknesses.
- Code-level insights: SAST provides detailed insights into the codebase, helping developers understand the root causes of security vulnerabilities. This information enables developers to make informed decisions and take specific actions to remediate the identified issues.
- Integration with development workflows: SAST tools can be integrated into development workflows, such as IDE plugins or continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. This allows for automated and regular scanning of code, ensuring ongoing security assessment and reducing the manual effort required for testing.

### Disadvantages

- False positives and false negatives: SAST tools may produce false positives, flagging code segments as vulnerable when they are not, or false negatives, missing actual vulnerabilities. This can lead to wasted time and effort in investigating and validating findings.
- Limited context: SAST tools analyze code in isolation and may lack the full context of how the code interacts with the application's environment. This can result in the detection of potential vulnerabilities that are not exploitable in practice or missing vulnerabilities that only manifest during runtime.
- Limited coverage: SAST primarily focuses on code analysis and may not cover security aspects related to the application's infrastructure, network, or configuration. Additional security testing techniques, such as dynamic testing or penetration testing, may be required to provide a more comprehensive assessment.
- Technical expertise required: Interpreting and acting upon the findings of SAST tools often requires a good understanding of secure coding practices and security vulnerabilities. Organizations need skilled developers or security professionals who can effectively utilize SAST tools and interpret the results accurately.
